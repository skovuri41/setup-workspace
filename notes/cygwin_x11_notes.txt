Fonts are globally managed by settings in /etc/X11/app-defaults. However, TrueType fonts can be locally set using ~/.Xresources.
To browse the list of fonts use
 
fc-list :fontformat=TrueType -f "%{family}\n" | sort -u | less
 
Test a font by specifyng in the xterm command -fa option
xterm -fa 'Luxi Mono' -fs 10
 
Where fa refers to the fonts face name, and fs, the font size.
 
Once happy with your font, apply to your application in ~/.Xresources
For example to apply for XTerm
 
! my customisations
XTerm*faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono
XTerm*faceSize: 11
 
The final step is to set these resource changes using xrdb
 
xrdb -merge .Xresources
 
So, next time you invoke a plain xterm command you will be greeted
with your new font.
